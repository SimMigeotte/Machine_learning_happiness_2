## Introduction
This paper aims to uncover common patterns of happiness among countries and develop accurate Machine Learning algorithms for predicting a country's happiness score. It begins with a review of recent literature and analyzes the 2016 world metrics dataset, which includes data from reputable sources. Various models, including linear regression, polynomial regression, Support Vector Regressor, Gradient Boosting, Decision tree, Random Forest, and Neural Network, are built to predict happiness values. The results are evaluated based on metrics such as MAE, MSE, and RMSE in the final chapter. This study aims to fill a research gap by examining the relationship between happiness and sustainability, specifically focusing on the challenge of defining sustainability within a social context.

## Literature Review
To align this work with curriculum of the MSc Sustainable Management & Technology (of which the authors are part of), this paper will analyze the relationship between happiness and SDGs across countries. While the SDGs do not explicitly mention happiness as a goal or target, many of the goals are directly related to promoting well-being and elevating societies. Previous research has highlighted a positive correlation between subjective well-being, SDGs index, and environmental indicators. The objective of promoting sustainable development is to improve the global standard of living. Studies have revealed a positive correlation between happiness and the environmental dimension of sustainability, emphasizing the significance of social sustainability for overall well-being. For more detailed information on the relationship between happiness and sustainability, please refer to the accompanying documentation.
As far as the variables that mainly affect happiness are concerned, the World World Happiness Report (WHR) is presented in the notebook. It identifies several factors that contribute to global declines in happiness, including the COVID-19 pandemic, climate change, and economic inequality. Nonetheless, another article published in the Journal of Community Psychology identifies social justice as the second predictor of people's happiness, following social capital. Similarly, in this instance, as previously mentioned, a deeper analysis of the topic is provided in the literature review of the notebook. 

## Clustering analysis
After checking the cleanness of the data and performing a dependent variable exploration, a clustering analysis was conducted. In light of the positive correlation between Ecological footprint and happiness discovered during the dependent variable exploration, we clustered countries based on levels of happiness and ecology and we analyzed the geographical relationship between the two. Through the testing of K-means and hierarchical clustering algorithms, we have found that the 5 clusters generated by K-means provide a more comprehensive depiction of regional disparities in happiness and ecological scores compared to the 3 clusters produced by the hierarchical algorithm. By incorporating a greater number of clusters, we can capture the nuanced variations within regions and gain a better understanding of the interplay between happiness, ecological scores, and geographical factors.


## Regression analysis
First, it was necessary to classify our research question. Happiness is measured on a continuous scale, entailing that the problem faced is an instance of a regression problem. In this regard, we also defined the metrics used to evaluate our models, that are: R2, MAE, MSE and RMSE, describing the reasons ceiled behind the choice of these measures. Consequently, all the models are applied, commencing with a baseline algorithm exemplified by Linear Regression, and progressing to gradient boosting, support vector regression, decision tree, random forest, until Neural Networks. For each of the examined models, we endeavored to enhance their performance by implementing optimized parameters or by applying regularization techniques. The result of each model was systematically reported in a common table, which is also represented below, which summarizes all the tests conducted.

We provide a detailed ranking for each evaluation metric in the notebook, here are we quote the most important considerations:
- The Neural Network Optimized model achieved the highest R2 score of 74.53% on the test set. Ridge and Lasso regularization techniques outperformed other nonparametric models, with R2 scores of 74% and 73.71% respectively. On the other hand, models based on 2 degrees polynomial regression lead to poor results with an R2 score of -84%. 
- Also according to the MAE metric, the Neural Network Optimized approach demonstrates the best performance, with a remarkably low value of 0.3773.
- The Neural Network Optimized model achieved the lowest MSE of 0.1883, indicating minimal squared deviations between its predictions and the actual happiness values. Lasso and Ridge regularization techniques also demonstrated solid performance.
- Lastly,the lowest RMSE on the test set is again achieved by the Neural Network Optimized, with an value of 0.4340. This indicates that the model's predictions exhibit minimal deviations from the actual happiness values. Similar conclusions as above for LASSO and Ridge. 

## Discussion
For the current problem, NN has shown to outperform other models in all the metrics considered. Indeed, NN models have the ability to capture complex non-linear relationships between input features and target variables, which characterize the patterns of the current happiness rresearch question. Nonetheless, NN models are also capable of automatically extracting relevant features from the input data. This alleviates the need for manual feature engineering, which can be a challenging and time-consuming process as NN models demonstrated, in this case, relatively shorter training and running times compared to other complex models. Furthermore, it is noteworthy that the Lasso and Ridge regularization techniques, known for their simplicity of implementation, exhibited the second and third lowest errors among all the metrics examined. This finding is encouraging as it indicates their suitability for addressing the research question at hand without requiring advanced machine learning expertise to deploy.
It is necessary to recognize that the dataset used in this study was relatively small, clean and it did not suffer from the problem of high dimensionality, with a larger number of features and potentially more complex relationships to capture, the training and running time of NN models may be affected. Therefore, testing the models on datasets with more features and potentially longitudinal data can provide insights into the scalability and robustness of NN models.


# Conclusion
In the present study, we conducted an exploratory data analysis comprising data visualization, clustering, and regression analysis to examine the intricate relationship between country-specific statistics and happiness. Clustering techniques were employed to categorize countries based on their happiness and ecological scores. 
Subsequently, a comprehensive assessment of various regression algorithms was performed to model the prediction of happiness scores using our dataset. Notably, a NN we built demonstrated exceptional performance in accurately forecasting happiness scores, followed by a polynomial regresson incorporating regularization techniques such as Lasso and Ridge. The caracteristics of the current dataset allowed us to achieve satisfactory results with a reasonable running time, however future research should explore the performance of the models analyzed on larger datasets.
